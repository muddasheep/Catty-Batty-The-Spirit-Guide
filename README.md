Read the file "ReadMeIfYouWant.txt" for more information.

As usual for long-running projects, it has exploded in complexity, and thus it's a bit of a mess, but I hope it can still be of use. The game has the following features that you might find interesting:

* 30 levels with 30 different mechanics (and additional levels in New Game+)
* Music layers using the Unity sound mixing
* Options menu (settings for audio, video, general settings, application quitting, etc.)
* SoundMan(ager): Class for playing sounds with features like audio pooling, pitch, volume, and not playing the same sound multiple times at the same moment
* Achievements: Class for unlocking achievements, can be plugged into any achievement system (Steam, PlayStation, etc.)
* A giant Gamemaster and Universemaster class that should inspire you to make something better
* Gridmanager, in case you want to make a game using grids
* IntroLoader scene for quick application launching
* Simple dialogue system inspired by Brackeys
* Saving/Loading savedata suitable for PC, Linux, Mac and consoles (Observer.cs)
* player_movement.cs for player-centric controls using Rewired
* Shader for the main camera (different colour modes)
* Vertex shader for spirit sprites (the tip of the flame moves when the spirit walks around)
* spirit_ai.cs, which shows you how to make a simple NPC movement behavior on a grid
* SteamManager.cs to set up a proper Steam connection

[!] This project will not run/compile. You will need the following to run this game:
* Rewired: https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/utilities/rewired-21676
* I2 Localization: https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/localization/i2-localization-14884
* Unity Editor 2020.1.2f1 (although it should be fine to upgrade)

You can use scripts, sounds, music, and sprites in your games.
